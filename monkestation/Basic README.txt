Ensure that as much of your content is within the Monkestation folder as possible.
Any edits you make outside of the folder should be tagged with comments such as:
// MonkeStation Edit Start
	edits and such.
// MonkeStation Edit End

Create a fork or local branch and do Pull Requests rather than just committing to master.
This makes it easier to both revert bad changes and also to keep a log of who has done what.
