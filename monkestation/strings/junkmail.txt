Step 1: you must make a live sacrifice, it can be anything, a human, a monkey, a slime or anything living! Step 2:after sacrificing the live sacrifice, get a photo of yourself and put the sacrifice's blood on the photo. Step 3:burn the photo of yourself with the sacrifice's blood on it and then copy and paste and share this message to other people on your PDA or through mail to another person faraway..after you've done all three of the steps and share this message to someone else you will be free from Nar'Sie's curse...
Within 5 minutes of reading this, you must purchase a pack of Uplift Smooth cigarettes.  You must then forward this message to at least 5 of your friends, instructing them to do the same.  Failure to follow these instructions will have dire consequences. Security will not leave you alone this shift.  Or next shift.  Or, maybe, ever again.  Your crewmates will come down with an infectious virus just before your next shuttle trip together.  Your department will become plagued with greytiders, unexplained fighting, and possibly vomit.  On you.  Also, there is a very great chance that an outbreak of Pierrot's throat will infect your station. Take no chances. Make your purchase, pass this on to your friends, and enjoy days of health and sanity ahead. The clock is ticking. Go, now.

<p>[The paper appears to be badly worn from age]</p><p>Welcome, gentlemen, to Nanotrasen.  Astronauts, war heroes, Olympians--you're here because we want the best, and you are it.  So, who's ready to make some science?<p>Now, you already met one another on the luxury shuttle ride over, so let me introduce myself.  I'm John Nanotrasen.  I own the place.  Transcribing this letter for me is the lovely Jacquelyn, my assistant.  Rest assured, she has transferred your honorarium to the charitable organization of your choice. Isn't that right, Jacquelyn? She's the backbone of this station. Pretty as a postcard, too. Sorry, fellas. She's married. To science.<p>There's a thousand tests performed every day here in our top-of-the-line departments. I can't personally oversee every one of them, so these letters will cover any questions you might have, and respond to any incidents that may occur in the course of your science adventure. Your test assignment will vary, depending on the manner in which you have bent your worlds to your will.<p>Those of you helping with the plasma harvesting today, just follow the green line to atmospherics.  Those who volunteered to be injected with lizard DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news.  Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of lizard men. Pick up a rifle and follow the blue line. You'll know when the test starts.<p>They say great science is built on the shoulders of giants. Not here. At Nanotrasen, we do all our science from scratch. No hand holding.
I own several IEDs for home defense, since that's what the founding greytiders intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my soda cans and glass shard spear. Stab a golf ball sized hole in the first man, he's dead on the spot. Grab my IED and throw it the second man, miss him entirely because it's fuse is too short and it blows off my leg. I have to resort to the welding fuel tank and welder at the department doors, "Tally ho lads" the explosion consumes two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off fire alarms. Pick up a glass shard and crawl toward the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on security to arrive since jagged glass wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding greytiders intended.
1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries. 2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. 3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

"To:NanoTrasen Central Command Dear Centcom, This is Corporate Representative Manuel Roberts III speaking, so far experiments at the colony and space station NCS Autumn of Fire have been doing very well.. Though I will say i am not quite sure if my letter will reach you all, cause you see.. Our Messaging Letter Transmitter and OUR ONLY Messaging Letter Transmitter and all of our fax machines have been heavily malfunctioning as of lately. Infact all of our fax machines have completely shutdown due to the massive electrode waves the new artifact we have recently found in the mines of this colony, have been producing during our many experiments on this mysterious new artifact. And while the experiments of this new artifact have been going good, one of our scientists has also made a MAJOR breakthrough in the research of said artifact, claiming that they are now able to understand on what the strange alien language of writing says on this newly discovered artifact. As for how things are going on the colony itself, things are kind of not looking too good for alot of the crew, I found out some reports of one crewmember having snapped and killed another crewmember and when he was apprehended by security, he constantly started screaming about how "THE GODS OF FLESH WATCHES ALL OF US!" and how "WE ARE DOOMED TO BE MERGED AND EVOLVED INTO ONE!!", whatever caused this man to go insane was strange and very interesting and when interrogated they started unstably ranting about the new artifact we found, in other notes another crew member was brought to our psychologist for the fact of how she keeps writing many strange paper scraps and leaving them in the hallway, drawings of artifact we are researching into and drawings of some weird creatures.. All we could get from her was that the drawings were stuff she saw in her nightmares.. Whatever is kind of causing this small mass hysteria among crew members is most definitely a coincidence, yet some crew members including some of security seem to believe it's that new artifact we found that's causing the madness in some of the NCS Authumn of Fire's crew, even that annoying sec officer Mr. Neumann who had to deal with a clown doing a prank that many had described to have gone "too far" believes this! Like how convinced are these people that they think it's just a stupid space rock artifact's fault? besides clowns do pranks just as far as what happened in the NCS Autumn of Fire anyways IN THE FIRST PLACE!! well despite all that has been happening soo far, hopefully this still working yet quite malfunctioning Messaging Letter Transmitter can get my message to you all on my report of this mess so far. See you all next report! NT Experiment Report:NT-90045-05 Experiment Classification:[CODENAME:CHAOS] From:NT Official Mr. Manuel Roberts III"
WANTED: Somebody to go back in time with me.  This is not a joke.  Meet me behind the holodeck, ask for Eric.  You'll get payed after we get back.  Must bring your own weapons.  Safety not guaranteed.  I have only done this once before. [Attached to the letter is a photo of a serious looking fellow with a serious looking mullet]
Seeking: new mime.  I have ordered several mimes, and all of them have been woefully inadequate!  It's so hard to find a decent mime these days.  I gave them everything they could possibly need, took great care of them, but every one of them were too lazy to even fix me breakfast!  I even gave them the most advanced state-of-the-art kitchenware with heat management, burn safety functions, voice control, and quick pre-heating!  If you apply BE SURE that you can perform at least BASIC duties for me, I WILL NOT abide any more LAZY mimes and will leave you a terrible review on Space Yelp!
