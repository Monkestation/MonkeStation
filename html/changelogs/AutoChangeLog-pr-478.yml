changes:
  - imageadd: Updated the sprites of the conveyor belts and the conveyor switches,
      ported and adapted from Tau Ceti!
  - refactor: Brought up to today's standards conveyor codes, alongside properly documenting
      it. Also changed how conveyor corners are handled to make them both more intuitive
      for mappers and for people in-game.
