changes:
  - rscadd: SM produced zaps can also generate power now so fire up those CO2 engines
      nerds
  - rscadd: Vehicles can now be zapped by both the sm and the tesla, they will shock
      all the people buckled to them
  - bugfix: Fixes a whole bunch of issues, teslas make more sense now
  - tweak: Tesla is more about destroy machines than hull now, but explosions still
      happen, also blue light tesla
  - refactor: Refactored tesla_act into zap_act, it now allows for other zapping methods.
      Not entirely optimal, but it'll do.
  - refactor: Refactored supermatter_zap(), it should be a lot cleaner now
  - refactor: Tesla Coils, and Grounding Rods are now subtypes of a common energy_accumulator
      type. This centralizes logic for smoothing energy release; converting between
      Joules, Watts, and internal energy units; and ensures that all such accumulators
      display and generate power along the same smoothing curve.
