changes:
  - tweak: Converted the auxiliary dock for the whiteship into maint and moved the
      construction area there, now the whiteship will be able to dock on a dedicated
      arm westward of the southern arrival arm on Flandstation.
  - tweak: The teleporter has been moved to where there was the construction area,
      now it's in a more logical area, in it's place, the library got more maintenance
      on Flandstation.
  - tweak: Modified Cargo and Engineering on Flandstation, now they should be slightly
      better.
  - tweak: Updated the tech storage, now it should have all the boards needed for
      a station in case of disaster.
  - bugfix: Fixed some odd stuff around Flandstation.
