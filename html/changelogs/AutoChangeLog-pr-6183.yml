changes:
  - rscadd: Reintroduced the accidentally removed illegal shuttle restriction. Illegal
      shuttles cannot be normally purchased, consoles need to be hacked or emagged
      to purchase them. Emagging a console will additionally allow you to log into
      console without access, while obscuring your real name.
  - bugfix: The communications shuttle now supports HTML formatting in messages.
  - bugfix: Fixes an embarrasing mistake where the communications console was hardcoded
      to only list the first 6 shuttles for purchase.
  - bugfix: Fixes minor issues with the communications console interface.
