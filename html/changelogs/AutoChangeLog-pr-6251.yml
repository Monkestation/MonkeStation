changes:
  - rscadd: New exploration targets are on the prowl!
  - rscadd: Several new RuinGeneration modules have been added to rotation.
  - tweak: Nearly every RuinGeneration module has been brushed up to code, and some
      have been entirely remapped from the ground up.
  - bugfix: VIP Missions now fail if the target is dead without a ckey to prevent
      softlocks.
  - tweak: VIP Targets can now have custom suits, masks, internals, and more that
      spawn with them rather than the standardized loadout.
