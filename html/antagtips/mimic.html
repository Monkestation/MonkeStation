	<h1>You are a Mimic!</h1>
	<img src="mimic.png"/>
	<p>You are a Mimic, an alien that made it's way on to the station.</p>
	<p>Mimics can break down doors and structures easily</p>
	<p>You can copy the form of any item you can see by clicking on it</p>
	<p>You can latch onto people by attacking them. While disguised, latching is instant.</p>
	<p>When you're latched onto someone, they won't be able to deal any damage to you, but you will be able to attack them.</p>
	<p>After you kill someone, you can absorb their corpse, and replicate.</p>
	<p>Your objective is to replicate and keep the mimics alive for as long as possible.</p>
